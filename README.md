# Sweater Weather
An application that will help you plan road trips. This app will allow users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination of their choice.

I am working in a service-oriented architecture and my focus is to expose an API that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements since the front-end will be communicating with this back-end application through the API.

*Note:* This is a final project for Module 3 of the Turing School of Software & Design Back-End Program (ACCET-accredited).

## Learning Goals
- Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- Expose an API for CRUD functionality
- Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Research, select, and consume an API based on your needs as a developer
